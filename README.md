# ATM_Interface
The ATM Interface in Java is a robust console-based application. Upon startup, users are prompted for their user ID and PIN. Successful entry grants access to various ATM functions, including:

1. Transaction History: View a log of past transactions.

2. Withdraw: Withdraw money from your account.

3. Deposit: Add funds to your account.

4. Transfer: Transfer money between accounts.

5. Quit: Exit the ATM interface.

This multi-class project provides a comprehensive banking experience.
